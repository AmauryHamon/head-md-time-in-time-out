- Focus on Twine and interactive narrative, leave pitch for now, it will come along with update narrative
- Do bridges between nautical terms & emotions
- Think about North South West East for trajectories
- Apply the idea of tempest and storms within real places: bank, post office, supermarket, shopping, queuing, etc.
- Build steps from calm to storm
- Be more narrative oriented, device can come later
- inspiration from old maps
- anything else than storms? Naufrages, sir√®nes, etc.
