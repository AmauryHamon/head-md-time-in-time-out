*Ocean of thoughts* is a contemplative navigation tool to embrace the times of wandering in your mind. Being the navigator of your thoughts, any oblique trajectories you pick will drift your vessel to colorful destinations, while a straight path will reach to ashore. As you navigate, the storm gradually builds up and affect your path. When it hits, your journey is reset, for you to further map other thoughts in this ocean.
