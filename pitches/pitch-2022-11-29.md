In *ocean of thoughts*, you are the navigator, exploring your thoughts in a storm cycle. If you feel like mind-wandering, you can choose to drift. At every step of your travel, by drifting you will discover new locations and characters, giving you new prompted insights in your thoughts. If you feel on a mission avoiding your task-unrelated thoughts, you can try and go ashore, but the device will keep questionning your path, your decision and your endgoal. In the end, you never reach ashore, as the more you navigate and discover, or the more you go obstinately try to go ashore and avoid the storm, the heavier the weather gets. Currents and winds will gradually reorient your drift after each pitstop to eventually reach the path of the storm, which will reset your position to the initial stage to discover again and again newly generated thoughts of interests.
