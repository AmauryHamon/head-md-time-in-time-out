In *ocean of thoughts*, you are the navigator, exploring your thoughts in a storm cycle. If you feel mind-wandering, you can choose to drift to discover new locations and characters. In case you feel on a mission, you will try instead to go ashore. The longer your journey, the heavier weather turns. In the end, you never reach ashore. As currents and winds gradually reorients your trajectory, you eventually face the storm. It will reset you to a new beginning of your journey, to discover again and again new places for thoughts.
