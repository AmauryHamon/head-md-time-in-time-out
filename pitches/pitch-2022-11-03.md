# Working Title: Ocean of Thoughts
- Due date: 2022-11-03:09:00
The capitalist society keeps on driving us to more productivity in our task-based daily life. Yet we remain mind-wanderers, our thoughts drifting away. In our ocean of thoughts, we strive to get our bearings in new situtations, self-reflection, and general happiness with our lives. Yet we lack a certain rigor to how and when taking those moments of drift. *Ocean of Thoughts* aims to set a new course to different point of views and perspectives. It evolves as a thinking machine wearable renewing periodically its generated prompts. The device becomes a navigator to mind-wandering. From reaching unexpected creative mindset or reaching better self-reflection, or decision-making.
