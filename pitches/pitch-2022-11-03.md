In *ocean of thoughts*, you are the navigator of your thoughts. Whenever mind-wandering in the verge of the storm,  embrace your thoughts drifting away and use this device as your vessel. It will then focus bears towards a new course of prompted ideas. This thinking compass generates keywords based on wind trajectory and barometer data. Once combined, a new undiscovered trajectory is set for you to set sail to and get away from the chaos of the tempest.
