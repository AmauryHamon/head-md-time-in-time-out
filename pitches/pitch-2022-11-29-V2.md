In *ocean of thoughts*, you are the navigator, exploring your thoughts in a storm cycle. If you feel like mind-wandering, you can choose to drift and discover new locations and characters. In case you feel on a mission, you will try instead to go ashore. The longer your journey, the heavier weather turns. In the end, you never reach ashore, as currents and winds will gradually reorient your decisions and trajectory until you face the storm, which resets you in the beginning of your journey to discover again and again newly generated locations for thoughts of interests.
