- Due date: 2022-11-02:09:00
The capitalist society keeps on driving us to more productivity in our task-based daily life. Yet we remain mind-wanderers, our thoughts navigating away. In our ocean of thoughts, we strive for better insights, self-reflection, and general happiness with our lives. Yet we lack a certain rigor to how and when taking those moments of break. *Second Thought* aims to give new inputs for different point of views and perspectives. It evolves as a thinking machine wearable renewing periodically its generated prompts. The device becomes a navigator to mind-wandering. From reaching unexpected creative mindset or reaching better self-reflection, or decision-making.
