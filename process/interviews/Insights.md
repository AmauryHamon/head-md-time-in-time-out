- People daydream everyday, for varying lenghts, at anytime of the day, A LOT
- During work or social interactions, people remain task-focused with task-related thoughts in mind, yet daydream somehow can happen on short spans, as micro distraction moments.
- Daydreaming spans longer while having a break, waiting, walking, commuting in public transports or driving, resting, being in an intimate space
