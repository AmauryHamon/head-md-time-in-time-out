1. All the days I wake up without plugging my phone, and yet I wake up at the exact same time of my alarm, or not.
2. All the moments alone in public, where you have an urge to pull out your phone and showing you are busy to your surroundings, instead of being confortable with you and yourself.

1. It's a book: [Ways to Pass Time Inside This Room, Laurel Schwust, Webb Allen…](https://store.are.na/products/ways-to-pass-time-inside-this-room?variant=42614661447831)
    Ideas for how to spend time inside a room that might also be an airplane. Originally created the summer before the pandemic, this prescient guide shares ideas to stay sane and have fun inside a confined area — alone, together, or alone & together.
2. It's an app: [Flight Simulator, Laurel Schwust & Soft](https://flightsimulator.soft.works/): An ode to airplane mode

3. It's an article: [On observing time, Jon Gacnik](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/on-observing-time/)
    Speed of internet versus speed of nature: two-minute refresh rate of the camera’s image is a cadence significantly slower than the responsivity we usually experience online.
4. It's a machine: [Thinking Machine, Thomas Geiger]!(http://www.twgeiger.de/images/thomas-geiger-denkmaschine.jpg)
    It consists of three turning discs, each with 50 words. By spinning the wheels the user receives a combination of 3 words that stays with the user throughout the day and serves as the basis for visualization. The Thinking Machine is a part of Thomas Geiger's daily practice and helps him to rediscover his surroundings through the filter of language.
5. Writers listing, describing, enumerating things: Umberto Eco, Georges Pérec…
