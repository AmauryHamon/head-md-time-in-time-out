# Based on your narratives, start materialising your object.

- Where is it worn? How is it worn? How do you interact with it?

    On the wrist/forearm, to navigate with a circular touch gesture similar to old ipods (see below)

- What proportions and dimensions would you like it to have (ideal size in mm)?

    Max 10cm*5cm
    
- What shape should it take?

    I'd like a round shape plane on the main side: so the user can touch and navigate as a ship wheel.

- Which materials would you like to use?

    ### Device materials for casing
    - Bioplastics â€“ using Algae [bioplastics](https://www.dezeen.com/2019/01/18/margarita-talep-algae-bioplastic-packaging-design/)
    - Ocean waste recycled plastics [ocean waste plastics](https://www.oceanwasteplastic.com/)

- To do so, search for existing object references with similar typologies.
    - They can be found [here](/process/object/references/)
- Check their dimensions out.

- With paper or cardboard, make 2D or 3D models to see what this means in 1:1.

- Make a 1:1 paper mock-up (only overall shape). Take a photo to document it. Keep the paper mock-up.

- Make a line sketch of your object and add dimensions to it. Scan or take a photo do document it.
