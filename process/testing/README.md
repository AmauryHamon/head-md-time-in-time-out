# Notes to define testing
- What are the objectives of this test? What do I need to test in my project?
    - I need to make sure users can understand main gestures touching directions leading to drift or going ashore
    - That the sea navigation universe is understandable by showing ship wheel visual, colors in LED animations
    - Users understand where interaction for gesture happens
    - Question What is perceived from users from those color moods
- What are my hypotheses?
    - The output and general narration is too abstract and won't be identifiable by users
- What is my test script (Detail step by steps what you need your audience to do)
    
TEST1: Gesture

    You have in front you a navigation device on which you must select your destination
    There is a single light blinking centered in the device
    
    0. intro	Approach the device	
	What can you tell of the device? Can you guess through what must you navigate?	
	How would you navigate/interact with it?		
    1. choice	Pick a destination	
	Why did you pick this destination?	
	What do you see ? describe	
    color	What do you see ? What do those colors mean to you? 	
    2. choice	Pick another destination or the same	
	How is it different than the previous?	
	Why did you pick this destination?	
	What do you see ? describe	
    color	What do you see ? What do those colors mean to you? 	
    3. choice	Pick another destination or the same	
	How is it different than the previous?	
	Why did you pick this destination?	
	What do you see ? describe	
    color	What do you see ? What do those colors mean to you? 	
    4. choice	Pick another destination or the same	
	How is it different than the previous?	
	Why did you pick this destination?	
	What do you see ? describe	
    color	What do you see ? What do those colors mean to you? 	
    5. no choice	Now what do you see?	
	What do you think happens?	
	6. back	What do you think happens now, what do you have to do?

TEST2: LED Visuals

    0. intro	Blinking center
	What can you tell of the device? Can you guess through what must you navigate?
    1. nav	Wheel
	What do you see ? describe
	2. bleu	Anim Bleu
	What do you see ? describe
	What do you see ? What do those colors mean to you? 
    3. line	What do you see ? describe
    4. vortex	What do you see ? describe
    5. random blink	What do you see ? describe


- If I need to do a A/B testing â€“ what would be an alternative that I could test?
    - Touch gesture VS mechanical ship wheel
- What materials do I need to do this test properly?
    Paper with LED dot sketch visuals
    Samples of Animations on LEDs
- How can I test these tasks or experiences? (Paper proto, Scenario? Wireframe of an interface)
    Paper proto
    Scenario
    Samples of animation on LED
- How long will my test last?
    5-10min per test
