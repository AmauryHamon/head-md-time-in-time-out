# Mind-wandering
is a broad term with no currently universal definition. According to McMillan, Kaufmann and Singer (2013) mind-wandering consists of 3 different subtypes: positive constructive daydreaming, guilty fear of failure, and poor attentional control. Whereas Smallwood and Schooler (2015) suggest that mind-wandering consists of thoughts that are task-unrelated and stimulus-independent. In general, a folk explanation of mind-wandering could be described as the experience of thoughts not remaining on a single topic for a long period of time, particularly when people are engaged in an attention-demanding task.

Task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs) are common in everyday life. They are exemplified by experiences like planning your day while getting ready in the morning or thinking about dinner when driving home from work. Not only are TUTs common, but they can also be disruptive during daily tasks requiring our focus. The human mind spends a great deal of time on thoughts unrelated to current tasks, known as task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs; Smallwood & Schooler, 2015).
