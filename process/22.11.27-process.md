# Deconstruct Rose of the winds as subdivisions of more and more precise trajectories:
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_rose](Source) The contemporary compass rose appears as two rings, one smaller and set inside the other. The outside ring denotes **true** cardinal directions while the smaller inside ring denotes magnetic cardinal directions. True north refers to the geographical location of the north pole while magnetic north refers to the direction towards which the north pole of a magnetic object (as found in a compass) will **point**. The angular difference between true and magnetic north is called **variation**, which varies depending on location.[20] The angular difference between magnetic heading and compass heading is called **deviation** which varies by vessel and its heading

The names given to these directions are usually derived from either locally-specific geographic features (e.g. "towards the hills", "towards the sea") or from celestial bodies (especially the sun) or from atmospheric features (winds, temperature)
Most mobile populations tend to adopt sunrise and sunset for East and West and the direction from where different winds blow to denote North and South.

## Wind trajectories
Trying to subdivide the drift trajectory into an idea of progression of the drifting process, so that defining a main word as starting point, it evolves in combination with other words to a more unexpected outcome.
