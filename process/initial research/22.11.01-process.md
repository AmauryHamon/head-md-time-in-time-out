# Key insights from observations
- people are not reflecting on themselves frequently
- 

After interviewing people, realised they tend to stay focused on task related suggestions by telling me their desired tool is an agenda/calendar. I am not interested in a productivity based wearable
Perhaps would be interesting to think what a thought calendar look like ?
I may need to rework my interview kit to better oriented towards task unrelated thoughts 

#

# Then what the fuck is it?
Is this a thinking machine?
A guide for mind wandering and self reflection?
A guide to care for others?
A creative thinking machine?


# Potential output
Prompting questions
thinking machine words combination
Word/sentence topic of discussion

# Risk 
The risk is it could be just another notification for people to erase from their feed. It better not be used during work, meetings or task focused events

# When should the wearable work?
Device should detect when people stay still:
- waiting, queueing, sitting in a bus, a car, with the arms not moving too much 
- When static is detected , would a haptic feedback invite the wearer to a mind-wandering suggestion? 

# Title ideas
- second thought 
- Mind-wanderer
- Daydream
