Those observations happened during my wait time in Bruxelles' Airport, Gate A, Starbucks, to get back to Switzerland.
Time is 6PM, flight departs at 9PM, long way to go.

It seems people without screens gazing at their faces almost don't exist anymore.
Whenever they do show up, it only lasts for a couple minutes, seconds top.
How long does it take until the urge of pulling out a screen comes back?

Sitting at one of the sides of the café, I have a proper 180° view of all sorts of people waiting, whether they gaze at their screens or humbly wait on their own. On my left is the exit of Starbucks, tables ranging from inside to outside. In front of me is the whole inside part of the café, with lounge chairs and tables, and a bigger open space style table to be shared. On the right side is the whole queue of customers and baristas set at each side of the bar.

People wait:
- inline to get their order taken
- inline to get their order 
- in the middle of the room to find a free seat & table, possibly one with a plug, not mine though, sorry not sorry
- seating, eating, drinking, either alone or in group

I am interested at looking at people in their non-social moments, and/or in their non-screen moments. People staying still within an active environment or flux of other people. I am interested at figuring out what drives people to those moments, and how to stimulate those more often. instead of replacing their life 
It seems to me those moments are crucial because less and less, we allow for them to happen and occure within our resting, commuting, waiting, and all sorts of non-productive oriented activities.

- 11 o'clock: a couple looking together at one smartphone. The woman lies her head on her partner's shoulder, while he scrolls through. 
- 2 o'clock: a couple seating and eating together. They don't talk, both seam in their thoughts, though exchanging looks.
- 10 o'clock: a guy in his sixties with a short sleeve harley davidson shirt gaze at airport people. His wife and daughter just arrived at the table.
- 11 oclock: a guy in big black puff jacket is desperately looking for a plug. His goal is clear, looking at all the busy plugged tables with the eye of judgment.
